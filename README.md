# MidiSynth7
A fully-featured MIDI software synthesizer written in C# WPF

This is a work in progress. Frequent updates will be made.
Any changes present in the 'studio edition' will reflect later on down the line for the other views.
*This is basically an open sourced rewrite & port from v6, with some major changes*

# Three different "editions"
I plan on implementing 3 different views or "editions" for users who are limited to their display size. At this time, only two editions are written.

## Studio Edition (As of 10/16/22)

# Key mapping

You can use your PC keyboard to play notes. For the full range keyboard, the key map only applies to the first 39 keys.

While keyboard support may be limited, the program supports external MIDI keyboard input.
